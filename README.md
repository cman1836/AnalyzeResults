# AnalyzeResults

## Introduction
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website in an attempt to understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.  The project contained three parts:
1. Probability
2. A/B Test
3. Regression Approach

## Results
The sample size was determined to be large enough to be considered statistically significant.  Based on probability, A/B testing, and regression, I was unable to find supporting evidence to conclude that the new page increases conversion rates vs. the old page.  The recommendation was to create a new landing page as the current "new" page is not creating the desired outcomes
